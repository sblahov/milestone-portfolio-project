                    <h4>I am passionate about web accessibility.</h4>
                    <p>As a person with a disability who has worked in advocacy, I have seen how often access barriers have kept people with disabilities from obtaining important information on the web. I decided to start taking Skillcrush courses and incorporating my own learning on web accessibility because I want to be a web developer who incorporates accessibility from the start, not just one who has to implement it later in her career. I am excited to learn and create websites that are usable by all people, and make the internet a more accessible place for people with disabilities.</p>
